I'm a Research Officer working with Prof. [Chengchun Shi](https://callmespring.github.io/) in the Department of Statistics, LSE. I am interested in developing computationally efficient algorithms & softwares with statistical performance guarantees for reinforcement learning. 

Previously, 

- I'm a Ph.D. working with Prof. [You Na](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/youna85902/na-you) and [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-650.html) in the School of Mathematics, SYSU since 2019. During that time, I work on high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean data.
