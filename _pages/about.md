I am an assistant professor of School of Mathematics at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/about/college-of-engineering-and-physical-sciences/mathematics). My research focuses on large language models, reinforcement learning and high-dimensional statistics, particularly on developing computationally efficient methods with statistical guarantees. 

Previously, 

1. I'm a Research Officer working with Prof. [Chengchun Shi](https://callmespring.github.io/) in the Department of Statistics, [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) (LSE). During that time, I work on reinforcement learning, causal inference and large-language model. 

2. Prior to 1., I'm a Ph.D. working with Prof. [You Na](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/youna85902/na-you) and [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-650.html) in the School of Mathematics, [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) (SYSU) since 2019. During that time, I work on high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean data. Prior to that, I obtained M.S. and B.S. in Statistics from SYSU in 2019 and 2016.
