  abstract={Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8% to 80.6% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok have been deeply integrated into our daily life. They now support a wide range of tasks – from dialogue and email drafting to assisting with teaching and coding, serving as search engines, and much more. However, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns, including the spread of fake news, the generation of misleading governmental reports, and academic misconduct. To address this practical problem, we train a classifier to determine whether a piece of text is authored by an LLM or a human. Our detector is deployed on an online CPU-based platform https://huggingface.co/spaces/stats-powered-ai/StatDetectLLM, and contains three novelties over existing detectors: (i) it does not rely on auxiliary information, such as watermarks or knowledge of the specific LLM used to generate the text; (ii) it more effectively distinguishes between human- and LLM-authored text; and (iii) it enables statistical inference, which is largely absent in the current literature. Empirically, our classifier achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing detectors, while maintaining type-I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {In real-world applications of reinforcement learning, it is often challenging to obtain a state representation that is parsimonious and satisfies the Markov property without prior knowledge. Consequently, it is common practice to construct a state larger than necessary, e.g., by concatenating measurements over contiguous time points. However, needlessly increasing the dimension of the state may slow learning and obfuscate the learned policy. We introduce the notion of a minimal sufficient state in a Markov decision process (MDP) as the subvector of the original state under which the process remains an MDP and shares the same reward function as the original process. We propose a novel SEquEntial Knockoffs (SEEK) algorithm that estimates the minimal sufficient state in a system with high-dimensional complex nonlinear dynamics. In large samples, the proposed method achieves selection consistency. As the method is agnostic to the reinforcement learning algorithm being applied, it benefits downstream tasks such as policy learning. Empirical experiments verify theoretical results and show the proposed approach outperforms several competing methods regarding variable selection accuracy and regret.}

Variations in its morphology are associated with various neurological and psychological conditions, making it a key focus in neurogenetics. Age is known to influence the structure and morphology of the corpus callosum significantly, complicating the identification of specific genetic factors that contribute to its shape and size. We propose a conditional strong independence screening method to address these challenges for ultrahigh-dimensional predictors and non-Euclidean responses. Our approach incorporates prior knowledge, such as age. It introduces a novel concept of conditional metric dependence, quantifying non-linear conditional dependencies among random objects in metric spaces without relying on predefined models. We apply this framework to identify genetic factors associated with the morphology of the corpus callosum. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this method across various non-Euclidean data types, highlighting its potential to drive genetic discovery in neuroscience.}

Using sparsity learning, we present an approach named SLIDE whose sample complexity is globally optimal. Furthermore, a tuning-free algorithm is developed to give a statistically consistent solution of SLIDE in polynomial time with high probability. On extensive benchmarked cases, the SLIDE approach demonstrates dominant performance in reconstructing underlying Ising models, confirming its superior statistical properties.

  abstract = {We consider the probabilistic simplex-constrained sparse recovery problem. The commonly used Lasso-type penalty for promoting sparsity is ineffective in this context since it is a constant within the simplex. Despite this challenge, fortunately, simplex constraint itself brings a self-regularization property, i.e., the empirical risk minimizer without any sparsity-promoting procedure obtains the usual Lasso-type estimation error. Moreover, we analyze the iterates of a projected gradient descent method and show its convergence to the ground truth sparse solution in the geometric rate until a satisfied statistical precision is attained. Although the estimation error is statistically optimal, the resulting solution is usually more dense than the sparse ground truth. To further sparsify the iterates, we propose a method called PERMITS via embedding a tail screening procedure, i.e., identifying negligible components and discarding them during iterations, into the projected gradient descent method. Furthermore, we combine tail screening and the special information criterion to balance the trade-off between fitness and complexity. Theoretically, the proposed PERMITS method can exactly recover the ground truth support set under mild conditions and thus obtain the oracle property. We demonstrate the statistical and computational efficiency of PERMITS with both synthetic and real data.

Prior work has shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is Markovian. However, the question of <em>why</em> the use of history should lower MSE remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.}

However, it faces challenges of distributional shift, where the learned policy may encounter unseen scenarios not covered in the offline data. Additionally, numerous applications suffer from a scarcity of labeled reward data. Relying on labeled data alone often leads to a narrow state-action distribution, further amplifying the distributional shift, and resulting in suboptimal policy learning. To address these issues, we first recognize that the volume of unlabeled data is typically substantially larger than that of labeled data. We then propose a semi-pessimistic RL method to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled data. Our approach offers several advantages. It considerably simplifies the learning process, as it seeks a lower bound of the reward function, rather than that of the Q-function or state transition function. It is highly flexible, and can be integrated with a range of model-free and model-based RL algorithms. It enjoys the guaranteed improvement when utilizing vast unlabeled data, but requires much less restrictive conditions. We compare our method with a number of alternative solutions, both analytically and numerically, and demonstrate its clear competitiveness. We further illustrate with an application to adaptive deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.}

However, existing distribution functions are defined in Euclidean spaces and no longer convenient to use in rapidly evolving data objects of complex nature. It is imperative to develop the concept of distribution function in a more general space to meet emerging needs. Note that the linearity allows us to use hypercubes to define the distribution function in a Euclidean space, but without the linearity in a metric space, we must work with the metric to investigate the probability measure. We introduce a class of metric distribution functions through the metric between random objects and a fixed location in metric spaces. We overcome this challenging step by proving the correspondence theorem and the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem for metric distribution functions in metric spaces that lie the foundation for conducting rational statistical inference for metric space-valued data. Then, we develop homogeneity test and mutual independence test for non-Euclidean random objects, and present comprehensive empirical evidence to support the performance of our proposed methods.},

  title         = {Quantiles, Ranks and Signs in Metric Spaces},
  abstract      = {Non-Euclidean data is currently prevalent in many fields, necessitating the development of novel concepts such as distribution functions, quantiles, rankings, and signs for these data in order to conduct nonparametric statistical inference. This study provides new thoughts on quantiles, both locally and globally, in metric spaces. This is realized by expanding upon metric distribution function proposed by Wang et al. (2021). Rank and sign are defined at both the local and global levels as a natural consequence of the center-outward ordering of metric spaces brought about by the local and global quantiles. The theoretical properties are established, such as the root-n consistency and uniform consistency of the local and global empirical quantiles and the distribution-freeness of ranks and signs. The empirical metric median, which is defined here as the 0th empirical global metric quantile, is proven to be resistant to contaminations by means of both theoretical and numerical approaches. Quantiles have been shown valuable through extensive simulations in a number of metric spaces. Moreover, we introduce a family of fast rank-based independence tests for a generic metric space. Monte Carlo experiments show good finite-sample performance of the test. Quantiles are demonstrated in a real-world setting by analysing hippocampal data.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new library named abess that implements a unified framework of best-subset selection for solving diverse machine learning problems, e.g., linear regression, classification, and principal component analysis. Particularly, abess certifiably gets the optimal solution within polynomial time with high probability under the linear model. Our efficient implementation allows abess to attain the solution of best-subset selection problems as fast as or even 20x faster than existing competing variable (model) selection toolboxes. Furthermore, it supports common variants like best subset of groups selection and l2 regularized best-subset selection. The core of the library is programmed in C++. For ease of use, a Python library is designed for convenient integration with scikit-learn, and it can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI). In addition, a user-friendly R library is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The source code is available at: https://github.com/abess-team/abess.},

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with constructing a confidence interval for a target policy's value offline based on a pre-collected observational data in infinite horizon settings. Most of the existing works assume no unmeasured variables exist that confound the observed actions. This assumption, however, is likely to be violated in real applications such as healthcare and technological industries. In this paper, we show that with some auxiliary variables that mediate the effect of actions on the system dynamics, the target policy's value is identifiable in a confounded Markov decision process. Based on this result, we develop an efficient off-policy value estimator that is robust to potential model misspecification and provide rigorous uncertainty quantification. Our method is justified by theoretical results, simulated and real datasets obtained from ridesharing companies. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/cope.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we are concerned about testing the homogeneity on paired samples with or without confounding variables. These problems usually arise in clinical trials, psychological or sociological studies. We introduce new nonparametric tests for equality of two distributions or two conditional distributions of random vectors on paired samples. We show that their test statistics are consistent but have different asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis, depending on whether confounding variables exist. The limit distribution of the test statistic is a mixed $\chi^2$ distribution when testing the equality of two paired distributions, while it is a normal distribution when testing the equality of two conditional distributions of paired samples. We conduct several simulation studies to evaluate the finite-sample performance of our tests. Finally, we apply our tests on real data to illustrate their usefulness in the applications.}

  abstract  = {The rapid development of modern technology has created many complex datasets in non-linear spaces, while most of the statistical hypothesis tests are only available in Euclidean or Hilbert spaces. To properly analyze the data with more complicated structures, efforts have been made to solve the fundamental test problems in more general spaces (Lyons 2013; Pan, Tian, Wang, and Zhang 2018; Pan, Wang, Zhang, Zhu, and Zhu 2020). In this paper, we introduce a publicly available R package Ball for the comparison of multiple distributions and the test of mutual independence in metric spaces, which extends the test procedures for the equality of two distributions (Pan et al. 2018) and the independence of two random objects (Pan et al. 2020). The Ball package is computationally efficient since several novel algorithms as well as engineering techniques are employed in speeding up the ball test procedures. Two real data analyses and diverse numerical studies have been performed, and the results certify that the Ball package can detect various distribution differences and complicated dependencies in complex datasets, e.g., directional data and symmetric positive definite matrix data.},

  abstract  = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent vision-threatening disease worldwide. Laser marks are the scars left after panretinal photocoagulation, a treatment to prevent patients with severe DR from losing vision. In this study, we develop a deep learning algorithm based on the lightweight U-Net to segment laser marks from the color fundus photos, which could help indicate a stage or providing valuable auxiliary information for the care of DR patients. We prepared our training and testing data, manually annotated by trained and experienced graders from Image Reading Center, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, publicly available to fill the vacancy of public image datasets dedicated to the segmentation of laser marks. The lightweight U-Net, along with two postprocessing procedures, achieved an AUC of 0.9824, an optimal sensitivity of 94.16&#x0025;, and an optimal specificity of 92.82&#x0025; on the segmentation of laser marks in fundus photographs. With accurate segmentation and high numeric metrics, the lightweight U-Net method showed its reliable performance in automatically segmenting laser marks in fundus photographs, which could help the AI assist the diagnosis of DR in the severe stage.},

It is not only important and imperative in regression analysis but also has far-reaching applications in every facet of research, including computer science and medicine. We introduce a polynomial algorithm, which, under mild conditions, solves the problem. This algorithm exploits the idea of sequencing and splicing to reach a stable solution in finite steps when the sparsity level of the model is fixed but unknown. We define an information criterion that helps the algorithm select the true sparsity level with a high probability. We show that when the algorithm produces a stable optimal solution, that solution is the oracle estimator of the true parameters with probability one. We also demonstrate the power of the algorithm in several numerical studies.},

  abstract  = {Technological advances in science and engineering have led to the routine collection of large and complex data objects, where the dependence structure among those objects is often of great interest. Those complex objects (e.g., different brain subcortical structures) often reside in some Banach spaces, and hence their relationship cannot be well characterized by most of the existing measures of dependence such as correlation coefficients developed in Hilbert spaces. To overcome the limitations of the existing measures, we propose Ball Covariance as a generic measure of dependence between two random objects in two possibly different Banach spaces. Our Ball Covariance possesses the following attractive properties: (i) It is nonparametric and model-free, which make the proposed measure robust to model mis-specification; (ii) It is nonnegative and equal to zero if and only if two random objects in two separable Banach spaces are independent; (iii) Empirical Ball Covariance is easy to compute and can be used as a test statistic of independence. We present both theoretical and numerical results to reveal the potential power of the Ball Covariance in detecting dependence. Also importantly, we analyze two real datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of Ball Covariance in the complex dependence detection.},

  title     = {Two-sample test for compositional data with ball divergence},
  abstract  = {In this paper, we try to analyze whether the intestinal microbiota structures between gout patients and healthy individuals are different. The intestinal microbiota structures are usually measured by so-called compositional data, composed of multiple components whose value are typically non-negative and sum up to a constant. They are frequently collected and studied in many areas such as petrology, biology, and medicine nowadays. The difficulties to do statistical inference with compositional data arise from not only the constant restriction on the component sum, but also high dimensionality of the components with possible many zero measurements, which are frequently appeared in the 16S rRNA gene sequences. To overcome these difficulties, we first define the Bhattacharyya distance between two compositions such that the set of compositions is isometrically embedded in some spherical surfaces. And then we propose a two-sample test statistic for compositional data by Ball Divergence, a novel but powerful measure for the discrepancy between two probability measures in separable Banach spaces. Our test procedure demonstrates its excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulation studies even when the simulated data consist of thousand components with a high proportion of zero measurements. We also find that our method can distinguish two intestinal microbiota structures between gout patients and healthy individuals while the existing method does not.},
